# How to use GitLab

## Creating a new file

Creating a new file using the GitLab front-end is easy. 

1. Navigate to: your project > Click the **+** symbol > Select **New file**
2. Provide the name for your file where it says "File name"
3. Once you are ready to commit your file to Gitlab, provide the 
   "Commit message" near the bottom.
   <div class="panel panel-info">
    **Note**
    {: .panel-heading}
    <div class="panel-body">

    This should help give context to the code being submitted. So if it's a new
    file it can say something along those lines. If you're updating existing
    code you should briefly describe what's being updated and why. This lets
    anyone looking at the code quickly understand the purpose of the last
    commit and can reduce the amount of time being spent parsing the code.
